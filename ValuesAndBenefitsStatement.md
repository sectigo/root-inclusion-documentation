# Values & Benefits Statement

Sectigo is one of the largest commercial CAs in existence today, catering to a large number of subscribers without targeting any specific field. We offer certificates through our own retail channels, enterprise CLM solutions, and through a wide range of partners across the globe.

We have built a good reputation in the industry and with our customers, and through our 20+ years in business we have attracted and retained staff that collectively bring a huge amount of expertise to our operations. We believe we are well positioned to grow and to accommodate both our customers and the relying parties that utilize the Apple Root Certificate Program in one way or another, both now and as the WebPKI continues to evolve.

Including Sectigo's new roots in the Apple Root Certificate Program will help to ensure that Apple's users are not negatively impacted by untrusted certificate warnings as we transition to using our new roots. As an existing CA already included in the Apple Root Certificate Program, we do not believe that including our new roots will noticeably increase the risks to Apple's users. 

At least one Root Store Operator has [proposed](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Root_CA_Lifecycles) a deprecation schedule for older root certificates, and several Root Store Operators have indicated a preference or a requirement for single-purpose root certificates going forwards. Our root inclusion request marks the start of us transitioning from our current general-purpose roots to new single-purpose hierarchies.

Over the last 2+ years we have dedicated a lot of time and effort into improving the effectiveness of our WebPKI Incident Response (WIR) team, which consists of staff members from many areas within the company, many of whom have been part of the WebPKI landscape for more than 15 years. Since its inception, the WIR team has defined and implemented processes and methods of responding to incidents, has proactively discovered and self-reported a significant number of incidents, and has spearheaded multiple efforts to reduce the number of potential compliance incidents that might impact us in the future. The WIR team meets twice weekly, to ensure a timely response to every compliance incident.

Several members of the WIR team are also part of the Sectigo Compliance team as well as the Policy Authority, and they maintain our internal and external documentation such as policy documents, perform internal audits, keep up with CA/B Forum and other PKI industry standards, and are the key figures during our audits. 

Sectigo currently has, and plans to continue obtaining, audits for WebTrust and ETSI, as well as ISO27001 and SOC2 security audits. With a large European presence we are compliant with and follow the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as specified in our [Private Policy](https://sectigo.com/privacy-policy) and available on our [Privacy Portal](https://sectigo.com/privacy-portal).

Sectigo and its employees also contribute to the WebPKI and CA community in other ways:
  - We are founder members of the [CA/Browser Forum](https://cabforum.org/), and we remain active in its ongoing activities. Two of our employees currently serve in working group Chair and Vice-Chair positions.
  - We actively contribute to ETSI standards. One of our employees has been working in the ETSI ESI TC for many years, including serving as editor of [ETSI TS 102 042](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102000_102099/102042/02.04.01_60/ts_102042v020401p.pdf) and [ETSI EN 319 411-1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/31941101/01.03.01_60/en_31941101v010301p.pdf).
  - We co-authored RFCs for [CAA](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8659) and [CT](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9162).
  - We built, maintain, and host [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/).
  - We have contributed to [ZLint](https://github.com/zmap/zlint) and [x509lint](https://github.com/kroeckx/x509lint), and one of our employees is the current maintainer of [Certlint](https://github.com/certlint/certlint).
  - We publish the ["Root Causes"](https://sectigo.com/root-causes) podcast, presented by two of our employees, which often touches on topics that are relevant to the CA community.
  - We are a CT Log operator.
  - In 2019, we [provided funding](https://letsencrypt.org/2019/05/15/introducing-oak-ct-log.html) to cover a significant portion of the cost to run the Let's Encrypt "Oak" CT Log.

We have also increased our internal awareness of compliancy with all relevant guidelines over the last few years, with initiatives including: 
  - Mandatory training modules in our internal Sectigo University training portal for all employees.
  - Optional "Pizzacast" sessions that each focus on a different department's role and functionality, in order to create a better understanding across the organization of how and why certain processes are the way they are.
  - A monthly internal newsletter containing both industry and company wide updates.
